# useSpinPlusTrialOrUpgradeFlow
___

This hook encapsulates the logic for handling the trial or upgrade process within the application, ensuring consistency and ease of use across different components that might need to trigger this process.

### Here's a simplified explanation of what it's doing:

1. It utilises a custom hook (`useTrialEligibilityFlow`) to manage trial eligibility flow, which involves resetting and executing the flow.
2. It sets up options for the trial eligibility flow based on whether the user chooses to skip, close, or succeeds in the process.
3. It defines actions for different eligibility scenarios, like going back if eligibility is undetermined, navigating to a trial modal if eligible, or to an upgrade modal if ineligible.
4. It returns a function (`executeSpinPlusTrialOrUpgradeFlow`) that, when called, initiates the trial or upgrade process based on the defined flow and options.
